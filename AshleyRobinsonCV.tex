      { Specifying and modelling architecture for the 3\textsuperscript{rd} and 4\textsuperscript{th} generation chipsets.
        Primarily focussing on LPDDR5-6400 SDRAM integration with the application processors and host CPU accesses.
        Including atomic semaphore operation, boot loading widgets and proprietary checksum code/cache design. 
        Responsibilities included releasing the silicon chip specification and working with hardware, silicon and 
        software engineers to incorporate their feedback. Additionally modelling with bespoke simulators written in
        C++ and Rust.
        }

\cventry{\hspace{0.5cm} Oct 2017 Sep 2022}{Graphcore Ltd}{}{}{11-19 Wine Street, Bristol, BS1 2PH, UK\newline Silicon Engineer}
      { Silicon Chip company designing Intelligence Processing Units (IPUs) for Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
        Member of the silicon engineering team primarily focussed on Digital Design but also involved in Design For Test, 
        Physical Design and Verification. Highlights include designing an on-chip virtual channel terabit interconnect, 
        a voltage droop limiter with reaction time of a few nanoseconds and manufacturing repair of the processor exchange logic
        using functional test vectors. Responsibilities also included interfacing with 3\textsuperscript{rd} party IP, managing RAM macro
        integration across frontend and verification plan closure.

\cventry{\hspace{0.5cm}Sep 2014 Jul 2017}{Cambridge Design Partnership LLP}{}{}{Church Road, Toft, Cambridge, CB23 2RF, UK \newline Consultant Electronics Engineer}
      {  A technology and product design consultancy. 
         Working on many cross discipline projects but remaining focused on the application of electronics; typically in consumer products.
         Core skills applied include analogue circuit design, PCB design and digital hardware design with concurrent low level software development. 
         Additional skills exercised range from basic mechanical engineering to high level software development.       
        Involved in many projects using inertial measurement units (IMUs) and other sensors to track user behaviour. This has been in the capacity of wearable technology for sports applications but also to gain user insights. A typical example would be instrumenting an existing product so a piece of electronics can wake-on-motion to log accelerometer and gyroscope data to later gain insights to use frequency and handling. Wearable sensor development has involved writing algorithms from the ground up to compute bio-mechanical metrics from raw IMU data which is then validated with motion capture equipment.
